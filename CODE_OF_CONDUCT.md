# Team Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for contributes, the commitment to a productive and respectful work environment, and steps to address unacceptable behavior. Developers should be dedicated to maintain a collaborative and professional space where everyone can contribute effectively.

## Community Guidelines

- **Be professional and respectful**: All interactions should be conducted with professionalism and mutual respect.
- **Be clear and transparent**: Important discussions should be documented, and major decisions must be agreed upon collectively.
- **Be supportive**: Provide constructive feedback to improve our work.
- **Be mindful of well-being**: Work-life balance is important. Overworking and neglecting rest are discouraged.

## Conflict Resolution

- Disagreements should be resolved through discussion and compromise.
- If no resolution is found, the project supervisors may be consulted.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project supervisors (@maidlandee, @marteinnlundi). All reports will be handled discreetly and fairly.

## Footnote

This Code of Conduct was adapted from the [Twitter Open Source Code of Conduct](https://github.com/twitter/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) and modified to fit the structure and needs of our team.
